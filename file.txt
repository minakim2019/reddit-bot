If we can’t completely eradicate the virus then at what
point do we just have to return to normal and live with it?
I’m afraid once we have a vaccine and some areas are free of
cases for a time they’re just going to lock down again once
there’s a single case.

Random question, I know everyone loves shitting on America,
but with countries like UK Italy Spain and Belgium having
higher death rates, why isn’t that more reported? Instead I
hear “oh one guy died from that sturgis rally!”

Out of curiosity what average percentage of flu deaths occur
with and without comorbidities? I’m curious if it is close
to this infamous (and misleading) 6% number.

How effective will any of the vaccines be? Are we talking
about 50-60% like the flu vaccines? If so, could that push
back covid-19?

So first of all, that title is man, that is some bait.
That's like one part in the whole thing   Second of all,
this interview is really fascinating.  First time I'm really
hearing about this guy without it being connected to some
other news story

[1mVitamin D deficiency raises COVID-19 infection risk by 77%, study finds[0m[4mTop Comments:[0m

Note that, like in all Vitamin D studies, this is
associative only, not causative. In other words. being
Vitamin D deficient is associated with higher risk. But it
does not address the scenario where a 3rd thing is the cause
of BOTH the deficiency and the risk, and therefore that
resolving the deficiency won't reduce the risk. This is in
fact very likely, as Vitamin D is the great tease of disease
research. It seems to be associated with better health in
all sorts of situations/diseases, but giving people Vitamin
D never seems to actually help. The reason for this is that
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with many socio-economic
factors that also make people less healthy and resilient.

A school in my county moved a bunch of classrooms into the
gym to make them easier to supervise because they were low
on staff due to teachers being in quarantine. The kicker?
They refuse to release how many staff and students are
currently in quarantine, citing privacy. This is in Florida.
Shocking, I know.

....yeah especially when you keep firing them whenever they
expresses safety concerns.

That's because they are listening to the most important
voice of all: $$$

It's not addressed in the article, but UNC has a top quality
epidemiology department. I can almost guarantee their advice
was ignored - if they were even consulted - about the
decision whether or not to open their campus.

You can’t catch coronavirus is you don’t KNOW about

What's the point of hiding data when you can just stop
testing all together?  Hey we are going to have a TREMENDOUS
vaccine pretty soon before the election, we don't need to
test anyone anymore. Zero new case and death!   I'm sure
someone's base has no problem with that. This pandemic is
already gone for them, right?

s=21  This is the head of Operation Warp Speed. Or he is at
least for now.  "There is a very, very low chance that the
trials that are running as we speak could read before the
end of Oct.," Slaoui said. "And therefore, there could be—if
all other conditions required for an [EUA] are met—an
approval. I think it's extremely unlikely but not
impossible.”

[1mOfficials from at least three states have suggested that they would refuse to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine if they believe it has not received adequate vetting by the federal government, or that it had been approved for political reasons.[0m[4mTop Comments:[0m

Residents of 50 states have expressed that thry would refuse
to take a Covid 19 vaccine if they feel it hasn't been
properly tested or is pushed through for political reasons.
At this point I'd trust a vaccine from almost any other
country over one from the US
